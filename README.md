# Raytracer

I am creating a Raytracer. For the basic parts I am following this fantastic book: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14yayBb9XiL16lmuhbYhhvea8mKUUK77W

I highly recommend it for anyone who's interested in programming (not just graphics).
I am working through it on Visual Studio, so my code will beslightly different.

Once I finish all 3 books (chapters?) I will try to keep building on top of it to make it more advanced.
